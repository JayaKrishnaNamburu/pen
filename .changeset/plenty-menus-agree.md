Fix the slash menu inserting the wrong block type.

`Pen.SlashMenu.List` in auto mode regrouped `items` by `display.group` and handed each option a counter that restarted from the grouped order, while `confirm(index)`, `select(index)`, and `selectedIndex` all index the flat `items` array from `useSlashMenu`. Any schema whose groups are not contiguous in registration order made the two orders disagree, and the default schema is one: it registers `bulletListItem`, `numberedListItem`, and `checkListItem` between `heading` and `codeBlock`, so `basic` resumes after `lists` has started. Choosing Code Block inserted a bullet list, Divider inserted a numbered list, and Quote inserted an image. Arrow-key navigation moved the active option through the flat order too, so the highlight jumped around the rendered list and `aria-activedescendant` named an option other than the visible one, against AX3.

`useSlashMenu` now returns items already partitioned by group, so the order the menu navigates is the order it renders, and the query path groups after its relevance sort so the closest match stays at index 0. The list builds group headings by breaking consecutive runs instead of regrouping, which means every option carries its real index in `items` and a list that ever saw an ungrouped array would repeat a heading rather than resolve the wrong block.

The ordering itself is DOM-free and now ships from `@input/pen-core` as `orderSlashMenuItemsByGroup` and `slashMenuGroupOf`, next to `shouldShowBlockInDefaultMenus` and the `allBlockDisplays()` registry it reorders, so a second renderer's slash menu inherits the invariant instead of reimplementing it (API6).
